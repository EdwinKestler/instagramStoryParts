# 🎬 InstaVideoSplitter GUI

A desktop video trimming tool built with Python and `CustomTkinter`, designed to quickly split long videos (e.g., for Instagram Stories) into smaller segments.

## ✨ Features

- Drag-and-drop GUI for easy video trimming
- Supports output segment durations: 15, 30, 60, 90 seconds
- Real-time progress bar and status updates
- Thumbnail preview of the video
- Auto-opens the output directory after trimming
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Clean, responsive layout using `CustomTkinter`

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Command Line Usage

Run the splitter directly from the command line:

```bash
python instavideosplitter.py myvideo.mp4 -d 60 -o output_folder
```

- `-d/--duration` sets the segment length in seconds.
- `-o/--output-dir` sets where parts are saved (defaults to the video folder).
- `-f/--offset` applies an offset after keyframe alignment. Use negative values
  to start earlier or positive to start later.
- `--allow-long-last` automatically keeps a final segment that is only slightly
  longer than requested.

The script prints progress in the terminal and, if the last part is slightly
longer than the chosen duration, asks whether to keep it unless
`--allow-long-last` is provided.

## 🖥️ GUI Usage

Launch the graphical interface with:

```bash
python instavideosplitter_gui.py
```

1. **Browse for Video** – pick the file to split.
2. **Select Output Directory** – choose where clips will be saved.
3. **Select ffmpeg Folder** – specify the directory containing the ffmpeg binaries if the bundled one does not work.
4. **Segment Duration** – select 15, 30, 60 or 90 seconds.
5. **Offset Slider** – fine tune each cut by ±5 seconds relative to the nearest
   keyframe. This lets you shift all parts slightly earlier or later.
6. Press **Trim Video** to begin. A progress bar shows the status and the output
6. Press **Trim Video** to begin. A progress bar shows the status and the output
   folder opens when done.

### Last Segment Behaviour

If the last portion of the video is shorter than the chosen duration it is
padded with black frames so every segment has the same length. When it is only
slightly longer (up to about 10 % beyond the duration) you will be asked whether
to keep the extra seconds. The `--allow-long-last` flag on the command line or
accepting the prompt in the GUI retains the longer clip.
